                                    bike-sharing systems to encourage the usage of cycling as an alternative eco-friendly mode of transportation.

                                    Hong Kong, with one of the most developed transport network in the world, fall far behind from those cities. Cycling
                                    has been perceived as a weekend entertainment more than a transportation mode owing to the unfriendly road design
                                    and government policies.
                                </h3>

                                    cost.

                                Despite the term of ‘bicycle friendly environment’ has been mentioned in the Policy Address 2016 for the first time,
                                the role of cycling is still only be regarded as a recreational activity in Hong Kong.

                                According to the Transportation Department’s Travel Characteristics Survey 2011, only 20% of the cycling trips connected

                                    Mun where most biking facilities and tracks were found.

                                    Apart from the city’s extreme density, hilly topography and unpleasant weather, highly connected public transportation
                                    also contribute to such perception.

                                    “Hong Kong has a really really excellent public transportation system and ninety percent of people don't own private
                                    cars to get around so if other modes are so convenient then why change anything. That hinders the possibility of
                                    promoting cycling in a rigorous way,” said Dr. Lachlan Barber, an assistant professor of Geography at Hong Kong Baptist

                                        Such view on the use of bicycle comes down to policy and thus hindered any further bike-friendly infrastructure projects
                                        in many new towns where bicycle use is still prominent.

                                Although various studies have been conducted by the government, the development of cycling has not been well incorporated
                                in Hong Kong’s transportation policies and mainly found in the New Territories and rural area.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead text-justify">
                                The “Third Comprehensive Transport Study”, which conducted by the Transportation Department in 1999, did not encourage
                                cycling as an alternative transport mode. Provision of cycling tracks was only suggested to be planned in the new
                                towns, where spaces and traffic conditions are allowed to form a “vehicle-segregated and interlinked system”.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead text-justify">
                                The “Cycling Study”, which conducted in 2003 to identify the role of cycling in Hong Kong, once again emphasised that
                                cycle tracks should still be implemented in the new towns.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead text-justify">
                                It was only until the “HK2030+ Study”, the government started to consider cycling can be an interconnection transportation
                                for the railway to improve the environmental quality and build up a green city.
                            </p>

                                Yet, recommendations like developing new cycle track network, improving existing bicycle facilities and strengthening
                                road safety education from these studies have not been carried out thoroughly.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead text-justify"> Meanwhile, cycling in the urban area is particularly discouraged by the government. </p>
                            <p class="lead text-justify">
                                Secretary for Transport and Housing, Professor Anthony Cheung Bing-leung once said in the legislative council that
                                “ Hong Kong's road traffic is heavy with carriageways and footpaths so congested that it is difficult to spare spaces
                                for developing tracks designated for cycling” and “due to safety consideration, the government does not encourage
                                the public to use bicycle as a transport mode in urban areas”.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead text-justify">
                                “I think that it's partly true. But a really important follow-up question is what do you do with a situation like
                                this? I think you can respond by trying to make it safer instead of suggesting that people are comfortable with the
                                status quo and there is no reason to change,” Dr. Barber said.

                                Hong Kong road planning and standards were adopted from overseas through colonial governance between 1950s-1970s,
                                according to Dr. Barber.

                                roads were built at the same time as the towns were developed.

                                Yet, the low connectivity between cycling tracks has long been blamed for hindering a bicycle-friendly environment.
                                From the map below, it shows how existing bike lanes and available parking lots mainly locate within the scope of

                                Lawmaker Edward Yiu suggests a simple low-cost solution could be to apply pavement markings that separate carriageways
                                and bike lanes, as other countries do.

                                "We can use one of the side streets that runs north to south and has quite low traffic to begin with, dedicate one
                                of those as a bike route, and then think about connectivity," added Dr. Barber.

                                Regarding the new development area, Macleod thinks current practices are very engineering driven and do not allow
                                urban design thinking. For example in Kai Tak development projects start with civil engineering development department.
                                Also, public participation in the early stage of planning is found inadequate.

                                “Sometimes modest changes with better urban design thinking will work, and do not need a detailed study of long term
                                to plan and implement,” said MacLeod.

                                For bike lanes, Macleod suggests that segregated cycle path could be the solution or bikes can go with the traffic,
                                while fences encouraging faster driving trend should be out of phase.

                                “In a city people relying on public transit so much, there should not be such a big priority for the car to move as
                                fast as possible,” said MacLeod.

                                Hong Kong as a whole, adopting cycling for commuting rather than merely for recreation, needs further studies and

                                walking or cycling it's always nice to have that as a choice. If people don't have that as a choice then I think
                                most of the spectrum for mobility is somewhat limited,” said Dr. Barber.
